- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use media queries to set display for each resolution.

### Continued development

I will continue learning media queries, it's really tricky to make your website responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Blend mix CSS](https://frontendresource.com/css-background-image-color/) - This helped me with mixing background color from the image with background image
